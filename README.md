# tla-es

Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae (TLA) backend.

Copyright (C) 2019-2021 Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften


## Overview

The TLA backend server is a Spring Boot application using Elasticsearch as a search engine.


## Installation

> **TL;DR:** run `SAMPLE_URL=http://aaew64.bbaw.de/resources/tla-data/tla-sample-20210115-1000t.tar.gz docker-compose up -d`

There are two methods for getting this thing up and running.

1. [As a Docker container setup](#1-using-docker)
2. [Run or build with Gradle](#2-using-gradle)


### 1. Using Docker

Requirements:

- Docker Compose

#### 1.1. Prerequesites

1. Create an environment variable template file `.env` based on the template coming with this repo:
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
2. Specify the location where a TLA corpus data archive can be downloaded using the `SAMPLE_URL` environment variable, e.g.:
   ```
   SAMPLE_URL=http://example.org/sample.tar.gz
   ```

#### 1.2. Run Setup

Start the docker container setup configured in `docker-compose.yml`:

    docker-compose up -d

This will build and run three containers:

- `tla-es`: Elasticsearch container
- `tla-ingest`: temporarily executed instance of the backend application, used for populating the Elasticsearch container
- `tla-backend`: the actual backend app

The `tla-ingest` container will take its time downloading the TLA corpus data archive file and uploading it into Elasticsearch.
You can check its progress by taking a look into its log output:

    docker logs -f tla-ingest


### 2. Using Gradle

Requirements:

- Java 11
- Elasticsearch 7.15.2 *or* Docker Compose

#### 2.1. Prerequesites

1. This method requires you to provide a running Elasticsearch instance. 
   Either you install it as an independent application from 
   https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch (e.g., as MSI)
   or, if you have Docker Compose, you can simply start one in a
   container by using the configuration coming with this repository:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d es
   ```
   Before continuing, make sure Elasticsearch is running by checking the output of `docker ps --all` or
   accessing [its REST interface](http://localhost:9200) in a browser (change `9200` in case that you
   set a different port via the `ES_PORT` environment variable).
   
   In case you have changed host name or default port, now follow [the instructions above](#11-prerequesites) to make sure you have set the correct environment variables `ES_HOST` and `ES_PORT` (for `SAMPLE_URL`, see next step).

2. Once Elasticsearch is up and running, TLA corpus data needs to be loaded into it. In order to do so,
   you at least need to set the `SAMPLE_URL` environment variable to a URL pointing to a tar-compressed TLA corpus data
   file. One way to do this is to create a `.env` file in the directory containing this README (cf. [the instructions above](#11-prerequesites)), and setting
   the variable `SAMPLE_URL` in there:
   ```
   SAMPLE_URL=http://aaew64.bbaw.de/resources/tla-data/tla-sample-20210115-1000t.tar.gz
   ```
   Make sure that the lines with ES_HOST and ES_PORT in `.env` are either deleted or filled with values, but not with values left empty.

3. Finally, download and store TLA corpus data from the specified source by running the `populate` gradle task:
   ```
   ./gradlew populate
   ```
> If you are on a Windows machine, you have to use the `gradlew.bat` wrapper instead.)

#### 2.2. Run application

Run the app using the `bootRun` task:

```bash
    ./gradlew tasks # lists available gradle tasks
    ./gradlew bootrun
```

> If you are on a Windows machine, you need to execute the `gradlew.bat` wrapper shipped with this repository.



## Tests

There are 3 Gradle tasks for running tests:

- `:test`: run unit tests
- `:testSearch`: run search tests against live Elasticsearch instance
- `:testAll`: run all of those tests

Note that due to the way Spring-Data works, there is an Elasticsearch instance required even for the unit tests,
although it may well be entirely empty. For the search tests however, the Elasticsearch instance must be fully
populated so that search results can actually be verified against the specified expectations. This means you must
have executed the `:populate` task (`./gradlew populate`) prior executing `:testSearch` or `:testAll`.

Search tests are being performed based on search scenarios specified in JSON files. The specification model can be
found in [`SearchTestSpecs.java`](src/test/java/tla/backend/search/SearchTestSpecs.java). Individual specification
instances consist of at least a name and a search command. JSON files containing a list of several search test
specifications have to be located within the classpath directory set via the
[application property](src/test/resources/application-test.yml) `tla.searchtest.path`, each under a sub-directory
whose name can be used to identify the entity service to be used to execute the contained search commands.
The paths used to identify the entity services can be found in the `@ModelClass` annotations of the entity services.

Test runs create JUnit and Jacoco reports at the usual output locations.

Limit test runs to single classes by using the `--test` option:

```bash
  ./gradlew test --tests=QueryResultTest
```


## Misc

*Note:* You can configure the Elasticsearch HTTP port to which the application will try to connect.
Both the Docker Compose configuration and the `bootRun` and `test` gradle tasks are going to read
it from the local `.env` file.

When running the application using the  `bootRun` task, comma-separated arguments can be passed via
`args` property in the following ways:

    ./gradlew bootRun --Pargs=--data-file=sample.tar.gz,--foo=bar
    ./gradlew bootRun --args="--data-file=sample.tar.gz --foo=bar"

Populate database with a corpus dump and shut down after:

    ./gradlew bootRun --args="--data-file=sample.tar.gz --shutdown"

There is a gradle task for populating the backend app's elasticsearch indices with corpus data obtained
from a URL specified via the `SAMPLE_URL` environment variable:

    ./gradlew populate

You can check for the newest version of package dependencies by running:

    ./gradlew dependencyUpdates
